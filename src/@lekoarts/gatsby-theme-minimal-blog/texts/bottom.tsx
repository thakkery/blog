      <h2>Welcome to my personal website</h2>
      <p>I'm a web developer, a gamer, and an entrepreneur. After turning 30, I wanted to try creating something personal. This website is that something â€”a place for all of my writing collected into my own corner of the internet. Most of my writing used to be hosted on <a href="https://ythakker.medium.com/">Medium</a>, but being a web developer I wanted to create something personalized for my visitors (that's you!). So welcome!</p>
