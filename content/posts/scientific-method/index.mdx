When simplified down to its core, science is a **process**. It's a process that takes an idea and refines it into a theory. Rarely, a law emerges from this process. The process boils down to a few repeatable steps. It starts with an ideaâ€”a hypothesis. Usually the idea has a cause and effect relationship. Doing something in a certain way leads to a specific kind of effect. Refining this idea, this **hypothesis**, to be crystal clear and measurable is the first step.

The next step is to come up with a set of experiments that can prove or disprove the correctness of this idea. Even if it seems obvious whether the idea is true or not, it's not necessarily obvious in every situation. Some situations may prove the idea to be correct while other situations may prove the idea to be incorrect. The goal is to come up with experiments that reduce uncertainty because uncertainty is the enemy of science. 

Once a few experiments have been planned for proving or disproving the correctness of the idea, next is to write these experiments down, plan them, and then execute them. It's important to write the experiments down in very specific detail and not deviate from this detail because the mind plays funny tricks when trying to prove or disprove ideas. It's easy to fall for ideas. Ideas are very powerful, but the goal of scientific experiments is to separate the wheat from the chaff.

After conducting the experiments that have been planned in detail, some ideas will prove to be more correct than others. Others will prove to be more incorrect than others. The worse situation is not incorrectness, but rather the lack of a definite conclusion. The lack of a definite conclusion usually means more experiments with larger sample sizes for an idea that may be mediocre at best. In Thomas Edison's words, "I've not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that didn't work." Spoken like a true scientist. This method can be used for all kinds of ideas ranging from inventions to business ideas. It's universal, and it's one of the greatest processes ever invented. Use it as much as you like.
