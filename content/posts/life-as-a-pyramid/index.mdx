Certain symbols are embedded into our psyche. The pyramid is among the most powerful of these symbols. They represent one of the most ancient structures created since the dawn of civilization itself. The Pyramids of Giza not only were thousands of years ahead of their time, they created a powerful symbolism that inspired the holy trinity in Christianity. They were both a manifestation of a primal instinct in us and a reinforcement of that symbol for thousands of years.

## The Pyramid as a symbol

Thy pyramid is a shape commonly found in nature. Its mathematical name is a **triangular prism**. Sand falling into an hourglass naturally shapes itself into a pyramid. The bottom builds the foundation. The top represents the new, the elite, or the divine. In this way, the mastery of any skill or art is comparable to the ascent of a pyramid. At first, you find yourself among the common person with little skill but maybe a small amount of natural talent. Through persistent refinement, skill develops and ascends up the layers of the pyramid to eventually find itself among the most refined artists.

The ideal diet is most commonly explained as a food pyramid. One of the basest sciences of nutrition is explained using this metaphor. The ancient Egyptians had good sense in using this shape for their tombs. They had a strong affinity for the afterlife, and this shape was the one to help them reach it. Their entire language was based on symbols, so it is no wonder that the symbol that they would use to represent afterlife and religion would be the pyramid.

In two dimensions, the pyramid is a triangle. The triangle is also commonly found in religious worship, namely in the holy trinity: the father, the son, and the holy spirit. It's also a symbol of power. The illuminati, an all-knowing mythical organization on the verge of a meme, has the triangle as their symbol. Is it only because the triangle is a common shape? Or is it also because it's a flattened pyramid?

## Road to self-understanding

In *Man and His Symbols*, the famous psychologist Carl Jung argues that dreams and symbols used throughout history are there to aid in understanding yourself. While some of the symbols discussed in the book may seem like a stretch, there is definitely a sense of power dwelling in the subconsciousâ€”a wisdom beyond age, an all-pervasive ether that controls our very existence.

Several psychologists believed, for good reason, that mastering your subconscious allows you to lead an enjoyable and fulfilling life. It only makes sense to start at the very beginning during the dawn of civilization. Just as all stories start from the beginning, understanding meaningful symbols should start from humankind's common beginning. In some religions like Buddhism and Hinduism, the subconscious is thought to be the seat of the super soul, a gateway to heaven. Each step in understanding the subconscious is itself like ascending the pyramid. After navigating the traps of several layers, at the top is enlightenment.
